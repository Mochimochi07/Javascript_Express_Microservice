# Javascript_Express_Microservice

This is my sample microservice. 

They are for educational purposes only.

microservices are little pieces of apps made to work each independently while being connected to each other.

like a one page per app while having more of them that have different functions within a specific requirement.

If you want to use it just use the proxy.

The proxy is the main server of the apps that combines all the microservices together.

yes, like the frontend servers but you are using backend servers.

You may need to open the microservice servers first all together within seperate command prompts for this to work.
